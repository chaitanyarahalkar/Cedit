# Editor
A minimalistic text editor for the terminal fanatics

## What is Editor? 

Editor is a zero-dependency text editor for the terminal. Editor is similar to other popular editors like Vim, Emacs, Nano etc. Editor is designed with the philosophy of minimalism and simplicity. It requires no external libraries (Not even [curses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library))) or dependencies for installation. It is just a single-file C program that caters all your editing needs. Editor can be compiled on any platform having GCC or the Clang C compiler. The idea behing Editor is to eliminate the key-binding complications of Vim and port the existing key-bindings of your familiar GUI based editors to CLI.
